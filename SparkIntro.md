## House Keeping

### Who's Here?

I love staying in touch here's a [link](...) to a form where you can add your details for me to stay in touch with you. I also love feedback good and bad! I love to get better at my job. So as we go though this course I want you to keep in mind that I will ask you to provide some feedback afterwards. You can keep it anonymous of choose to tell me who you are. See feedback form here: [Feedback Form](...)
